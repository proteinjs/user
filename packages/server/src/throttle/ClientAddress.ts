 * The client's address, as a throttle should key on it.

 * Behind Google's external Application Load Balancer the `X-Forwarded-For` header ENDS with the
 * two entries the balancer appends — `<client-ip>,<load-balancer-ip>` — and everything before
 * them is whatever the client itself sent. So the client is the second entry from the right:
 * - never the LAST entry: that is the balancer's own forwarding-rule address, the same for every
 *   visitor. It is what express's `request.ip` resolves to under the server's `trust proxy 1`
 *   (one trusted hop: the Google front end that opened the connection), so a throttle keyed on
 *   `request.ip` there is one bucket for the whole world;
 * - never the FIRST entry: a client can send its own header, and the balancer keeps it.
 *
 * Only when the server trusts a proxy (the deployed shape; `trust proxy` is unset in
 * development) is the header read at all. A request that did not come through the balancer —
 * no appended pair: an in-cluster call, a probe — and every request in development key on the
 * connection's own address.
